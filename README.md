Aeroelastic Study of Leading Edge Minitabs for Gust Load Alleviation

This repository contains the complete summary of my masterâ€™s thesis conducted at TU Delft. The research focuses on the aeroelastic analysis of leading-edge minitabs as an innovative approach to gust load alleviation in aerospace applications.

The repository includes:

    Technical Details: Comprehensive analysis, methodologies, and results documented in detailed PDF reports.
    Key Findings: Insights into the effectiveness of leading-edge minitabs for mitigating gust-induced structural loads.

Feel free to explore the resources, replicate the analyses, and build on the findings. Contributions and discussions are welcome!
