# Aeroelastic Study of Leading Edge Minitabs

This repository contains the results and summary of my master’s thesis on the aeroelastic behavior of flexible wings with leading-edge minitabs for gust load alleviation. Below is the structure of the repository and an example document referencing images.

## Research Objectives and Questions
Can Minitabs be introduced to a flexible wing design as a method to enable active gust load alleviation?

  1. What is the influence of a minitab deployment over aerodynamic factors such as lift and load distribution, spanwise local angle of attack etc. during cruise conditions?
  2. When these minitabs are deployed in flight over a flexible (aeroelastic) wing, what are the temporal aerodynamic and structure responses of the wing?
  3. Given the knowledge of the timescales of the effects of the minitabs, develop a scheme for deployment of the minitab for an incoming gust encounter to maximize load alleviation.
