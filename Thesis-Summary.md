# Aeroelastic Study of Leading Edge Minitabs

This repository contains the results and summary of my master’s thesis on the aeroelastic behavior of flexible wings with leading-edge minitabs for gust load alleviation. Below is the structure of the repository and an example document referencing images.

# Thesis Summary: Aeroelastic Study of Leading Edge Minitabs

This document summarizes the results of the aeroelastic study conducted for leading-edge minitabs designed for gust load alleviation.

## Key Results

### 1. Lift Distribution
The optimized configuration of the minitabs demonstrates a significant improvement in lift distribution. See the figure below:

---

### 2. Structural Displacement
The structural displacement due to gust loads is shown in the next figure. The configuration successfully reduces displacement magnitudes:

For a detailed explanation, refer to the [full thesis document](Thesis-Full.pdf).

## Notes
1. Replace `lift_distribution.png` and `structural_displacement.png` with your actual images in the `Images/` folder.
2. Upload your repository to GitHub, and verify that the images render correctly in the Markdown preview.
